<p>I work as a Senior Software Engineer with significant skills as a backend developer and a background in project management. I enjoy building complex systems and mentoring developers to achieve goals because I have a history of producing quality software products and projects.

When I am not working, I try to use my creativity towards game development and game engine design because it's an area where I enjoy the most. Technology and learning new things motivates me to take on difficult problems and create fun games to play.
